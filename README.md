# spring5jokes
A Jokes Web Server and Website based on Spring 5 and React.

This uses the springguru library chuck-norris-for-actuator in order to generate a number of Chuck Norris jokes and then send them via a REST API to a React client application.

WARNING: a lot of things here were done quick and dirty, but I would show case this as what I can do in about 2-3 hours.


# In order to run the project:

Inside the root project run `mvn spring:run`.

Inside the spring5jokes-client run `npm start`.
